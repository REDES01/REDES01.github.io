    <h1>
        Shadow Platformer
    </h1>
    <p>
        Shadow Platformer is game base on a very simple idea <i>"don't touch the shadow on the ground, it will hurt
            you"</i>. After I creating the initial demo, I ask Zejun to join the team and we together applied for the
        Magic Maker Program, which allows us to further develop the project under supervision from RIT's
        faculty.<br><br>
        We spent a whole summer and working remotely during Covid is very challenging. Besides Zejun goes back to China
        while I was in the US, the time zone difference makes pushing the project even harder. The team was really small
        and it a way it could be a good thing, but when it came to production, we soon discovered that we need artists.
        The scope of the project was not very realistic at first place and time management is a disaster. <br><br>
        Eventually we made some progress but because of the lack of the playtesting resources and all those factors I
        mentioned above, at the end of the summer, the project felt more like an extension of the initial demo, rather
        than something closer to a real game.<br><br>
        We learned a lot from this experience. Below are some images of the levels we built.
