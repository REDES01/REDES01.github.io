    <h1>
        A windy night
    </h1>
    <p>
        After learning some basic theory about drama, in class I am asked to created a story-driven game and it turns
        out to be very challenging. Coming from a different language background, it is hard for me to write natural
        English dialogue. <br><br>
        I try me best to manipulate the player's emotion by creating intense moments intentionally. I also want the
        story to be
        confusing in a way. Many games start with the protagonist lost his memory and I kind of like the approach to
        invoke player's curiosity. I failed to have enough meaningful feedback after completion, please provide any feedback to 
        <b>xz5607@rit.edu</b>. It would be very helpful.<br><br>
        Here is the link for the game: <br><br>
