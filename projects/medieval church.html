        Composing for game is best course I took in RIT. Thanks to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, all my
        music teachers are very patient and motivating. <br><br>
        I spent a lot of time to make music in that semester and my instructor Tom Davis is the one makes those time
        worthwhile. I don't come from a music background and the class is surprisingly not that hard. I learned a lot of
        things. I used Ableton Live to created music and intergrated it into a Unity scene using Wwise. Wwise is the
        game industry's standard software to deal with sound. I am very satified with the learning outcome and my final
        project.<br><br>
        This learning experience tells a lot about what makes learning joyful. 1. The content should be highly related
        to the learner and be useful.
        2. Feedbacks are provided in a meaningful and instant way. 3. Everything should be clear, which requires
        teacher's through understanding of the content. <br><br>

        Here is the video link for the final result: <br><br>
