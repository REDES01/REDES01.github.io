        Sybolica
    </h1>
    <p>
        Symbolica is a world where precious gems are used to create powerful symbols that hold the key to the kingdom's
        prosperity and security. However, a wicked sorcerer known as the Shadow Mage has stolen the gems and uses them
        to enslave the kingdom.<br><br>
        As a member of a small rebel alliance, your task is to use your skills in gemcraft to create powerful symbols
        that can help defeat the Shadow Mage and his minions. Navigate through the Shadow Mage's fortress and fill the
        5x5 mosaic with symbols of the six types of gems: Ruby for power, Sapphire for knowledge, Emerald for growth,
        Amethyst for balance, Topaz for protection, and Diamond for purity.<br><br>
        The alliance owns a mysterious and ancient artifact known as the "Shadow Bag." The Shadow Bag is said to contain
        gems of immense power that can aid in the player's quest to build their symbols.<br><br>
        As the players compete against each other, they must use their gems strategically to overcome challenges and
        defeat the Shadow Mage before their opponent does.
