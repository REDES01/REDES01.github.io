        Symbolica
    </h1>
    <p>
        <i>Symbolica is a world where precious gems are used to create powerful symbols that hold the key to the
            kingdom's
            prosperity and security. However, a wicked sorcerer known as the Shadow Mage has stolen the gems and uses
            them
            to enslave the kingdom.</i><br><br>
        Symbolica is a year-long individual project. I am always very critical about many sides of the experience
        provided by GDD. One aspect is that most of the class projects feel like practices. After having a very bad
        experience with randomly assigned teammates in board game class due to the vision differences. I decided to
        create a real game that is eventually publishable in my way and by myself. <br><br>
        Every week I go to Crash Test which is a half offical event where people bring board games and have some
        playtests. It took me a whole year to develop the game and eventually I feel like it is publishable. <br><br>
        I don't want to spoil the details of the game and here is an image of the game:
